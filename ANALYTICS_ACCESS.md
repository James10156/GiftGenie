# Analytics Dashboard Access Guide

## üîê Admin Access Control

The analytics dashboard is **restricted to admin users only** for security and privacy reasons:

### Why Admin-Only?
- **Privacy**: User behavior data is sensitive and shouldn't be exposed to regular users
- **Business Intelligence**: Analytics provide competitive insights that should be protected  
- **Data Aggregation**: Individual users seeing aggregate data could reveal usage patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Server performance and error rates are operational concerns

## üéØ How to Access the Analytics Dashboard

### Step 1: Create a User Account
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the app in your browser
3. Register a new account or use an existing one

### Step 2: Promote User to Admin
Currently, for **demo purposes only**, any authenticated user can promote others to admin status.

#### Option A: Using the API directly
```bash
# First, get your user ID by logging in and checking /api/auth/me
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  --cookie cookies.txt

# Then promote the user to admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/promote-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "YOUR_USER_ID_HERE"}' \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  --cookie cookies.txt
```

#### Option B: Using the helper script
```bash
node scripts/promote-admin.js <username>
```
This will show you the exact steps and commands needed.

### Step 3: Access the Dashboard
1. **Refresh the page** or log out and log back in
2. You should now see an **"Analytics" tab** in the navigation
3. Click the Analytics tab to view the comprehensive dashboard

## üîí Production Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: In a production environment, you should:

1. **Require existing admin authorization** for the promote-admin endpoint
2. **Use proper role-based access control (RBAC)**
3. **Implement audit logging** for admin actions
4. **Add IP restrictions** for admin endpoints
5. **Use environment-based admin creation** rather than API endpoints

## üéâ You're All Set!

Once you have admin access, you'll have full visibility into:
